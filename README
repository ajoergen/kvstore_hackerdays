This is an application creating language models based on n-grams:
=================================================================


This is a application for doing a spellchecker based on a ngram model. It is using the play framework for
generating the user interface, and giving acccess to the akka actor system. The application is based on the
method described in [1]. This model has been scaled down to be able to run on a laptop by Peter Norvig [2], and
this is where the data sets are taken from.

Setup and run:
==============
Download typesafe activator from http://www.typesafe.com/activator and run the activator script in this directory.
This will result in a sbt prmpt.

[NGrams] $ update
[NGrams] $ compile
[NGrams] $ test # to run the tests
[NGrams] $ run # to run the application in development mode defauls to http://localhost:9000

The project is already setup for idea, but you will probably need the scala plugin. If you prefer eclipse just
run

[NGrams] $ eclipse

at the prompt. Again you want the scala ide installed.
